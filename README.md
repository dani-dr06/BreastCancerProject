# Breast Cancer K Means Algorithm Project

Breast cancer is a big issue in women’s health. With a cancer’s stage being one of the biggest 
factors affecting a patient’s prognosis, early detection and treatment are crucial and can 
potentially lead to breast cancer going into remission. The purpose of this project is to carry out 
a k means algorithm in Python to analyze breast cancer data and predict the class of the patient 
(benign cells or malignant cells) based on 9 attributes: clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, 
uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland 
chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitoses.

## Data Set
Data Set
The data comes from Dr. Wolberg’s Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data.
The data set consists of 11 columns, which are further explained in the Final Project ipynb file.


## Phase 1
Phase 1 of the project consists of obtaining the data and loading it in a data frame, imputing 
missing values with the mean, and computing mean, median, standard deviation of each of the 
attributes, as well as drawing histograms for each of the attributes.
