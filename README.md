# Breast Cancer K Means Algorithm Project

Breast cancer is a big issue in women’s health. With a cancer’s stage being one of the biggest 
factors affecting a patient’s prognosis, early detection and treatment are crucial and can 
potentially lead to breast cancer going into remission. The purpose of this project is to carry out 
a k means algorithm in Python to analyze breast cancer data and predict the class of the patient 
(benign cells or malignant cells) based on 9 attributes: clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, 
uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland 
chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitoses.

## [Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data)
The data comes from Dr. Wolberg’s Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data and a download is linked above.
The data set consists of 11 columns:

| ***Columns*** | ***Attributes*** | ***Names*** | ***Values*** |
| ------- | ---------- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | Patient ID | Scn | Integer |
| 2 | Clump Thickness | A2 | 1 - 10 |
| 3 | Uniformity of Cell Size | A3 | 1 - 10 |
| 4 | Uniformity of Cell Shape | A4 | 1 - 10 |
| 5 | Marginal Adhesion | A5 | 1 - 10 |
| 6 | Single Epithelial Cell Size | A6 | 1 - 10 |
| 7 | Bare Nuclei | A7 | 1 - 10 |
| 8 | Bland Chromatin | A8 | 1 - 10 |
| 9 | Normal Nucleoli | A9 | 1 - 10 |
| 10 | Mitoses | A10 | 1 - 10 |
| 11 | Class | Class | 2 (benign) or 4 (malignant) |
