# Breast Cancer K Means Algorithm Project

Breast cancer is a big issue in women’s health. With a cancer’s stage being one of the biggest 
factors affecting a patient’s prognosis, early detection and treatment are crucial and can 
potentially lead to breast cancer going into remission. The purpose of this project is to carry out 
a k means algorithm in Python to analyze breast cancer data and predict the class of the patient 
(benign cells or malignant cells) based on 9 attributes: clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, 
uniformity of cell shape, marginal adhesion, single epithelial cell size, bare nuclei, bland 
chromatin, normal nucleoli, and mitoses.

## [Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data)
The data comes from Dr. Wolberg’s Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data.
The data set consists of 11 columns:
* Patient ID (Scn)
* Clump Thickness (A2)
* Uniformity of Cell Size (A3)
* Uniformity of Cell Shape (A4)
* Marginal Adhesion (A5)
* Single Epithelial Cell Size (A6)
* Bare Nuclei (A7)
* Bland Chromatin (A8)
* Normal Nucleoli (A9)
* Mitoses (A10)
* Class

Each of the attribute columns (A2 - A10) have values from 1 to 10, while the class column has a value of either 2 (benign) or 4 (malignant).
